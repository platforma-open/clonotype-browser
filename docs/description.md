# Overview

Provides an interactive interface for browsing, exploring, and annotating T/B cell receptor clonotypes from V(D)J sequencing data. The block takes clonotyping results as input and enables users to examine clonotype characteristics, frequencies, and distributions across samples.

The block supports custom annotation scripts that allow users to tag clonotypes based on various criteria such as frequency thresholds, sequence characteristics, or sample-specific patterns. Annotated clonotypes can be tracked, filtered, and exported for downstream analysis. The interface provides multiple views including per-sample clonotype tables, overlap analysis between samples, and statistical summaries of clonotype distributions.
